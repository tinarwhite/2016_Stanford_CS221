jupyter notebooks

ROM_Autoencoder.ipynb 
takes you through the steps to implement the autoencoder

ROM_LSTM.ipynb 
takes you through the steps to implement the LSTM network

these two jupyter notebooks (ipynb files) document what everything is and what commands to run to get results and visualize them
